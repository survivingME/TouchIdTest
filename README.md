# TouchIdTest
A demo like email professor

I wanna add a Touch Id valitation to the app whenever you enter it.
The way is:
Import the LocalAuthentication.framework in the appDelegate.swift,then create a func to realize the function,then use 
the func under func Application and applicationWillEnterForeground.
